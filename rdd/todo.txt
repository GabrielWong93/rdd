General To Do's:

- update my gitignore?
- put this file as an rst elsewhere
- tutorial of how/why to use each function
- tests to put in a tutorial, but not as functions:
    - continuity plots
    - density plot
    - balance, randomness test (though they aren't actually needed)
    - discontinuity reg test
    - show a spline
- in each input, can i specify the required input?
- additional functions to create:
    - bin test
    - other mccrary tests?
